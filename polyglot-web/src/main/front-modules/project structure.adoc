## how to use ngRX
1. First create an action. An action has a type and defines the type of the action.
This is only for dispatching the action.
2. now, we need a listener when an action is dispatched. this is done in a reducer. The reducer takes the current state and the action and it will return a new updated state.
3. to read data from the state, selectors are used

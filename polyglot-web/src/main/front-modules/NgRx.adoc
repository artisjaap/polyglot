props<{user:UserLoginResponse}>()
);

export const logout = createAction(
"[Top Menu] Logout"
);`



Reducers:: Listen for a current action and modifies the internal state
Effects:: sideeffect that happens on actions. They start from the actions observer, filter out a specific type of action and use tap() to execute the sideeffect
 Side effects can be read/write to local storage, save or load data from the backend
Selectors:: Selectors are like a query to retrieve data from the storage. They typically start from a featureSelector to select the root of a specified part and then further query down
Entity:: Identifieable entities with CRUD operations. This is a state that extends EntityState. It allows simple modification of the data with the entityAdapter
